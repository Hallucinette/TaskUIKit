**Work in progress**

### Create a ToDoList application in MVP using UIKit.

The application will be structured around three distinct screens:

- A list of tasks -> Done
- Task details -> WIP
- Adding a new task

From the application, you should be able to view the list of tasks, edit, delete, and add new ones.

The tasks are available on AirTable.
